This folder contains assembly and machine code for the individual functionality/ 
features we will be testing. At the end, we should combine all the files into one
big assembly file with a state machine implementation. Master file is called demoFile. It will have all of the demo modes
we can have and has a base state that reads in the switch values.

May need to add a reset ability.
